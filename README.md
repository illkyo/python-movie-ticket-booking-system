# python-movie-ticket-booking-system
Designed for a fictional chain of cinemas based in England called 'The Horizon Cinemas'. This is a movie ticket booking system with a simple GUI and made using only the base libraries in Python like Tkinter.

Completed in 2024. This was my submission for the coursework component of the module 'Advanced Software Development', part of the Computer Science Bachelor's Degree course by UWE (University of West England) for the second year. With this submission I got 80 marks out of 100 for the component, a passing grade. A coursework specification document is available in the repo for further reading on assessment details.

# How to Use
Open the file 'horizon_bksys.py' in a code editor such as VS Code and run the code. 'db_setup.py' may need to be run in the same way if example login details are not working. Data entered in the system can also be viewed in the sys.db file as it is the database of the system.
